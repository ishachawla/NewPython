Saving and Retrieving Information:

From The New York Times API we fetch results for two things:

Articles published about most viewed books, and
Books information based on the division among Category (Fiction, Travel, Sport)
From the data fetched(and saved as a .json file) we aim to determine the number of articles books/articles were published in a certain year. These graphs represent the distribution of books/articles printed in 2 consecutive years. Fig1 and Fig2 show the books and articles printed in 2016 and 2017 respectively whereas Fig3 shows total books and articles published in these years.

Fig 1 Fig 2 Fig 3

The Categorical Article year file and categorical book year file shows all the book and articles printed in a certain year and the total number of articles/books that were published in a certain year under that category.

Additionally, I also incorporated a function where if the user enters the section of the book/article a CSV file will be generated that will have all the essential aspects of the books/articles that come under that classification
