# Analysis 2

_**Saving and Retrieving  Information:**_

From The New York Times API we fetch results for two things:
1. Articles published about most viewed books, and
1. Books information based on the division among Category (Fiction, Travel, Sport)

* From the data fetched(and saved as a .json file) we aim to determine the number of articles books/articles were published in a certain year.
These graphs represent the distribution of books/articles printed in 2 consecutive years.
Fig1 and Fig2 show the books and articles printed in 2016 and 2017 respectively whereas Fig3 shows total books and articles published in these years.

* Additionally, I also incorporated a function where if the user enters the section of the book/article a CSV file will be generated that will have all the essential aspects of the books/articles that come under that classification
